The intent of this project was to develop a system to manage a small transportation logistic business. Small business finds it difficult to find small, simple and cheat systems for them. The design involves embedding a browser on a swing application through JCEF, implementation of the Google Maps Distance Matrix API and database manipulations. The application provides convenient and efficient tools to manipulate database tables, plan routes, calculate budgets through distances, calendar and printing interactions. The JCEF browser allows the user to moke route planings on the application. The Google Maps Distance Matrix API obtains routes origin, destination, distance, duration, eg. in the format of an XML file. The budget calculator needs the XML file to get the distance. The calendar allows dates manipulation and schedule printing.
